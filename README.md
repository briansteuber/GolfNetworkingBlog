# Golf Networking Blog 
cpsc-314-web-development-final-project-briansteuber created by GitHub Classroom
# Description
This project emulates a blog. I intend to use this blog to communicate via golfers. If a person wants to play at a club that they are not a member at, they can create an account on my blog site and reach out to someone from that club. This blog was created using the MERN Stack.
# Table of Contents
1. Create Account Page
2. Login Page 
3. Blog Page
# Installation
To install, simply clone this repository or download the zip file.
One must install mongoDB, bcyrpt, and slug to run this web app.
One must need two collections, one named 'articles' and the other 'users'.
This is all stored in my 'golfnetworkingblog' database.
After this open the app in Visual Studio Code. 
Next, open up a terminal in VSC and cd into "GolfNetworkingBlog"
Afterwards, do npm run theStart.
Then, go to a browser and type in: localhost:3001
# Usage
You should start at the Create page and it will ultimatley link you to the blog page. When an account is created, you will be prompted to go to the login page and login to the account you just created. From there you will login and be at the blog page. In the blog page, you can customize settings like the about me info, and social media account names. Since this is a blog, users will be able to post, edit, delete, and reply to blogs. My blog incorperates all of these.
