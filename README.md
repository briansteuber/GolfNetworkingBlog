# Golf Networking Blog 
cpsc-314-web-development-final-project-briansteuber created by GitHub Classroom
# Description
This project emulates a blog. I intend to use this blog to communicate via golfers. If a person wants to play at a club that they are not a member at, they can create an account on my blog site and reach out to someone from that club. 
# Table of Contents
1. Create Account Page
2. Login Page 
3. Blog Page
# Installation
To install, simply download the zip file.
After open in Visual Studio Code. 
Next, open up a terminal in VSC and cd into "GolfNetworkingBlog"
Afterwards, do npm run theStart.
Then, go to a browser and type in: localhost:3001
# Usage
You should start at the Create page and it will ultimatley link you to the blog page. When an account is created, you will be prompted to go to the login page and login to the account you just created. From there you will login and be at the blog page. In the blog page, you can customize settings like the page name, about me info, and social media account names. Since this is a blog, users will be able to post, edit, delete, and reply to blogs. My blog incorperates all of these.
# Contributing
If one would like to contribute to this page, I could use help with converting this data that is stored locally to a database like MongoDB. I also could use some help polishing up the look of my page and some of the JQuery that is used.
